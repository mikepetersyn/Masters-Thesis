\section{Principal Component Analysis}
This chapter focuses on dimensionality reduction of data in the context of \gls{pca}. First, the application of dimensionality reduction in general is motivated by various examples. Then, the core idea based on the separation of signal and noise in data is presented. After this, a concrete statement of the problem is introduced. In addition, key model assumptions and a solution approach is presented and followed by a mathematical derivation of the eigencomposition for solving \gls{pca}.
