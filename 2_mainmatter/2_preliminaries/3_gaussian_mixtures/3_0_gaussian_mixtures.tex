\section{Gaussian Mixtures}

% This section focuses the concept of \acrshort{gmm} for density estimation. For this purpose, the Gaussian normal distribution is presented first, by introducing basic definitions for the probability density functions and describing the closure properties of the distribution. For this purpose, at the beginning a short motivation for the application of the presented model will be given. Then, mixture models in general and \acrshort{gmm} in particular are defined. After that, two main concepts will be explained. First, the \acrshort{gmm} is interpreted in terms of a \acrshort{lvm}. Second, the \acrshort{ema} is presented, which performs the computation of model parameters of latent variable models in an iterative scheme.
