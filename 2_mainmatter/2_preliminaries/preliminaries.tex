\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{ch:preliminaries}

Various concepts are used to realize the proposed architecture. This chapter serves to provide the reader with a basic background knowledge regarding the context of this thesis and the employed algorithms. Section~\ref{sec:intrusion_detection} introduces the topic of intrusion detection and covers general basics of \glspl{ids}, specific knowledge in the context of attack detection using network flows, and the presentation of the current state of \glspl{cids}. Section~\ref{sec:locality_sensitive_hashing} then describes and formalizes an algorithm called locality sensitive hashing. Subsequently, Section~\ref{sec:gaussian_mixtures} introduces \glspl{gmm} in the context of generative models. Finally, an introduction to the topic of dimensionality reduction using \gls{pca} is given in Section~\ref{sec:principal_component_analysis}.
