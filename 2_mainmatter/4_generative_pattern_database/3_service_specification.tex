\section{Service Specification}\label{sec:service_specification}

In Section \ref{sec:high_level_overview}, the roles of the clustering, filtering and compression operations within the architecture and the idea of the global view have been roughly explained. These concepts are implemented within the processing pipeline that has been referred to in Section \ref{sec:architecture_specification} as four consecutive and event-based services, which are described in detail by focusing on a single service in each subsection.
