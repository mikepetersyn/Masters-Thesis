\section*{Abstract}

%However, when considering the development of the current threat environment, the effectiveness of conventional intrusion detection systems is limited. Technology trends, such as the internet of things or cloud computing, are main drivers for increasingly blurring corporate boundaries in the context of interconnection of infrastructures and shared resources. This transformation increases the potential attack surface of productive computer systems for large-scale and high-velocity cyber attacks, which traditional IDSs have limited effectiveness due to their isolated nature. For example, such stand-alone IDS will not be able to create connections between security events that occur at different infrastructures simultaneously. Due to the mentioned increase of attack surface that is related to the size of current computer networks, attackers may attempt to obfuscate the characteristic overall sequence of the intrusion by spreading single attack steps.
